# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Here you can find my personal projects that might be coded somewhat competently, though that is not promised.


## About me
- I enjoy programming in Java, Python, and C the most, but I also know C++, R, Lua, and Javascript as well!
- I am currently interested in low-level programming as well as AI programming, and currently am involved in research regarding AI modeling.
- My favorite things to code are simulations/interactable programs the most, so that's why there is code for 2 graphical engines on this github.
- Favorite video game series is Mario, with Super Mario Sunshine being my favorite game. It is a **big** reason why I was interested in Computer Science from such a young age!
